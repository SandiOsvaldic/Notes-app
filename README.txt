This is a README text document for the app "sticky Notes", made by Sandi OsvaldiÄ‡.

To use the app, simply open it. You will see a plus, "+". Once the "+" is clicked, 
a sticky note (small text area) will be added. you can then type anything you want
in there. To create a new one, simply press "+" again. You can create as many of 
them as you want. IF you wish to delete a sticky note, using the right mouse 
button, double click on the note you want to delete. It will then ask you to
confirm your choice, or go back. That is it.

The purpose of this app is mostly for my portfolio. This is my first app created.
I hope you enjoy using it.
